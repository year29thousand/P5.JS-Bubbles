# P5.JS-Bubbles
A Simple bubbles project, this is the first time that I used classes in P5.JS

Github MUST READ:
  The main branch:
  
  The main branch is essentially the originally uploaded code, the very first github version of the program...
  
  The Program branch is the CURRENT/LIVE version of the program, this branch exists in order to give year29thousand access to editing the program directly from github without need to redownload and reupload the files from P5.JS
  
  The editor used to make this program originally is P5.JS, search it on google, they have a free online editor.
  
  The program's github.io site can be found here: https://year29thousand.github.io/P5.JS-Bubbles/
