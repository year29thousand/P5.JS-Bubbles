    <h1>BUBBLES! (A little experiment with classes)</h1>
    <p>Made by Sprizzy2468 known as year29thousand on github..... this is the first time <br> that I use classes in p5.js <br> This is the second version of Bubbles!<br></p>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/year29thousand/sketches/y0OInTAJS">Check out the source code</a>
    <p>Right Click = changes bubbles' colors... Left Click = Grab and drag bubbles around! </p>
    <p>The sketch should be right bellow this text    P.S : If you're lucky enough... It might load with 50 bubbles! One More thing, this only works on a computer... ENJOY!!</p>
